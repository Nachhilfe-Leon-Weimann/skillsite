/**
 * The health report the deploy checks: it polls the endpoint until `status` is
 * `"ok"` and `version` is the version it just released, so a container still
 * running the old image turns the deploy red (skill-platform release flow,
 * decision J).
 *
 * `APP_VERSION` is inlined at build time by `next.config.ts`, which reads the
 * root `package.json`. It cannot be read at runtime: the standalone bundle the
 * image ships carries no root `package.json`. An image somehow built without
 * one reports `"unknown"` - a failing deploy rather than a wrong version.
